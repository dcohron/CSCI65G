    <p>This is where we pick the central rectangle.  It consumes 60% of the height and width and is located in the center of the current drawing rectangle.  Note that we are working in the redraw coordinate rect, NOT the frame of the view, but that for this example those two things are the same.  We start by outlining the central rect in red, then filling the total rect with blue then filling the inner rect with the specified color.</p>
